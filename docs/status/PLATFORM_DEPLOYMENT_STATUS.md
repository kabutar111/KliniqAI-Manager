3. **Security Rules**: Production-ready Firebase rules
4. **Environment Variables**: Production configs
5. **Domain Setup**: kliniqai.com configuration

## Timeline to Beta
With July 30 deadline (31 days):
- **Week 1**: Complete frontend development
- **Week 2**: Testing and bug fixes
- **Week 3**: Content creation and seeding
- **Week 4**: Beta user onboarding

## Critical Path Items
1. Complete KPFG frontend → Enable content creation
2. Deploy KP-Medizin-Trainer → Student access
3. Create initial content library (50+ questions)
4. Setup user onboarding flow
5. Configure production Firebase

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Firebase project setup for production
- Domain configuration (kliniqai.com)
- SSL certificates
- CDN setup for performance
- Monitoring and analytics

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Technical architecture solid
- **Medium Risk**: Timeline for frontend completion
- **High Risk**: User acquisition without deployed platform

## Next Steps
1. Focus on completing KPFG frontend
2. Create staging environment for testing
3. Begin content creation in parallel
4. Setup beta user communication channels
5. Prepare onboarding materials
