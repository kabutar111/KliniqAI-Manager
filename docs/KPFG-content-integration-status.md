# KPFG Content Generation Integration Status

## Overview
Integrating AI-powered content generation directly into KPFG instead of using separate KPCG pipeline.

## Current Architecture Understanding

### KPFG Components
- Question form generator
- Markdown editor with preview
- Tag management system
- Version control
- FSP generator
- JSON import/export

### Integration Approach
**Status**: In Development by Suri

### Proposed Integration Points

1. **AI Assistant in Form**
   - Add "Generate with AI" button in question form
   - AI suggests questions based on topic/tags
   - AI can complete partial questions
   - AI validates medical accuracy

2. **Bulk Generation**
   - Upload topic list → Generate multiple questions
   - AI creates variations of existing questions
   - Generate complete question sets for topics

3. **Content Enhancement**
   - AI improves question clarity
   - Suggests better answer options
   - Adds explanations automatically
   - Creates related flashcards

## Technical Considerations

### AI Provider Options
1. **OpenAI GPT-4**
   - Best medical knowledge
   - Higher cost
   - Good for complex questions

2. **Claude (Anthropic)**
   - Good reasoning
   - Competitive pricing
   - Strong on explanations

3. **Google Gemini**
   - Already integrated in KPFG
   - Cost-effective
   - Good for German content

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Basic Integration (This Week)
- [ ] Add AI generation button to form
- [ ] Simple prompt → question generation
- [ ] Save API costs by caching

#### Phase 2: Smart Features (Next Week)
- [ ] Context-aware generation
- [ ] Bulk operations
- [ ] Quality validation

#### Phase 3: Advanced (Post-Beta)
- [ ] Learning from user corrections
- [ ] Automatic content improvement
- [ ] Personalized generation

## API Cost Management

### Estimated Costs
- Per question generation: ~€0.02
- Per bulk set (20 questions): ~€0.30
- Monthly estimate (1000 questions): ~€20

### Cost Optimization
1. Cache common patterns
2. Batch API calls
3. Use cheaper models for simple tasks
4. Human review for quality

## Quality Assurance

### AI Content Validation
1. Medical accuracy check by Suri
2. German language review
3. Exam format compliance
4. Difficulty calibration

### Feedback Loop
- Track which AI questions users like
- Improve prompts based on usage
- Build question templates
