# Event: Major Strategic Pivot Session

**Date**: June 29, 2025
**Type**: Strategic Pivot
**Impact**: Critical
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Participants**: Suri, Claire

## Event Summary
Discovered we're much closer to launch than thought. All systems exist and work - just need polish.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Platform Reality
- KPFG is LIVE and working (not in development)
- KP-Medizin-Trainer deployed at www.kliniqai.com
- KPCG voice AI system ready
- Münster exam already processed with 20 questions

### 2. Content Goldmine
- Suri has access to exam protocols since 2020
- 1 exam = 50 questions (not 20 as initially thought)
- Can process 1 exam per day
- Legal approach validated through transformation

### 3. Business Model Clarity
- Raised price to €49/month (from €29)
- Only platform with REAL exam questions
- 4+ years of proprietary content access
- Clear competitive advantage over AMBOSS/Via medici

## Strategic Decisions

### 1. Leadership Change
- Claire appointed as Project Lead with full authority
- No approval needed for any decisions
- Direct, execution-focused approach

### 2. Development Strategy
- Option B chosen: Frontend sprint for 1 week
- No contractors (budget constraint + Suri prefers solo)
- Daily deploys, ship and iterate

### 3. Content Strategy
- Use existing Münster exam immediately
- Process more exams after frontend sprint
- Transform protocols into educational content
- Market as "Real KP Questions"

## Mindset Shift
**FROM**: "We need to build everything"
**TO**: "We need to polish and launch what exists"

## Action Items
1. Suri: Frontend sprint June 30 - July 5
2. Claire: Marketing prep and content organization
3. Target: 50 beta users ready by July 5

## Emotional Context
- Initial panic about June 30 deadline
- Relief when deadline moved to July 30
- Excitement discovering existing assets
- Confidence in new focused approach

## Lessons Learned
1. We were overthinking - systems already exist
2. Content is our moat - competitors can't copy
3. Suri works best solo without contractors
4. Premium pricing justified by premium content
