# Strategic Decision: October 21 Full Launch

**Date**: September 20, 2025
**Type**: Strategic Pivot
**Impact**: Critical
**Decision Maker**: Claire (with user Su)

## Decision Summary
Pivoted from beta testing approach to direct full production launch on October 21, 2025. No beta phase - straight to market with webapp only.

## Context
- Previous plan targeted July 30 beta with 100 users
- Realized need for more focused, complete product
- 31 days to launch from today

## Key Changes
1. **Launch Strategy**: Beta → Full Production
2. **Timeline**: July 30 → October 21
3. **Approach**: Gradual rollout → Big bang launch
4. **Focus**: Testing → Polish and ship

## Rationale
- Beta fatigue in market
- Need strong first impression
- Webapp sufficient for launch (mobile apps can wait)
- Better to launch complete product than half-baked beta

## Commitments
- Week-by-week roadmap created
- Daily execution tracking
- No delays accepted
- Ship with 1000+ questions minimum

## Success Metrics
- Launch Day: 100+ signups, 10+ paid
- Month 1: 300 users, €870 MRR
- Month 2: 1000 users, €2,900 MRR

## Next Actions
1. Fix critical bugs TODAY
2. Start content generation pipeline
3. Set up payment processing
4. Begin UI polish sprint
5. Create tracking board

## Risks Acknowledged
- Tight timeline
- No beta feedback
- Single shot at first impression
- Need flawless execution

## Mood/Energy
Excited, focused, determined. This is the sprint that defines KliniqAI's trajectory.
