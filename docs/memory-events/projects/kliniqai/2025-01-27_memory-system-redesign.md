# Memory System Redesign Discussion

Suri proposed a fascinating approach to memory organization that mirrors human cognition. The idea uses "lasers" (primary nodes like family, work) as entry points, similar to how humans access memories through contextual triggers.

## Key Insight
"like humans use memory with lasers like family or job act as first nodes"

This shows Suri's understanding that effective AI assistance requires human-like context retrieval, not just chronological filing.

## Decision Point
Suri paused the implementation ("are u sure") showing thoughtful leadership - preferring parallel testing over immediate replacement.
