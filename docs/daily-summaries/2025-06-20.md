# Daily Summary - June 20, 2025

## Meeting Time: Async Discussion

### Attendees
- [x] Suri
- [x] Claire

## Yesterday's Progress

### Suri
- Continued KPFG integration work
- Identified critical blocker: Quiz engine missing from KP-Medizin-Trainer
- Analyzed KP-Medizin-Trainer codebase (technical debt found)

### Claire
- Created comprehensive KPFG Integration Approach document
- Set up beta user tracking system with Telegram workflow
- Major Content Pipeline improvements (350% better extraction, 3-5x performance)
- Reorganized documentation structure
- Updated memory files with latest insights

## Today's Accomplishments

### Content Publishing Architecture Designed
- **Major Decision**: Hybrid approach with Cloud Function `publishToKlinIQai`
- **Publishing Flow**: KPFG SavedForms → Cloud Function → published_quizzes → KP-Medizin-Trainer
- **Cost Optimization**: 7-day cache strategy to reduce Firebase reads by 95%
- **Security Philosophy**: No restrictive DRM, enable student collaboration

### Technical Architecture Work
1. **Created Implementation Documents**:
   - `KPFG_PUBLISH_TO_KLINIQAI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
   - `KPMT_PUBLISHED_CONTENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

2. **Key Technical Decisions**:
   - Publishing button in SavedForms (not Generator) for better UX
   - Cloud Function for consistent server-side transformation
   - No role validation in KPFG (internal tool)
   - IndexedDB for larger cache storage
   - Differential sync for efficient updates

3. **Cost Analysis**:
   - Current: 150,000 reads/month
   - With optimization: ~7,500 reads/month (95% reduction)
   - Approach: Metadata-first loading, batch operations

## Critical Blockers Update
- **No quiz content** - Solution designed with publishing workflow
- **Cost concerns** - Addressed with 7-day cache and optimization
- **Content transfer** - Architecture complete, ready for implementation

## Implementation Plan
### Week 1
- Implement `publishToKlinIQai` Cloud Function
- Add publish button to SavedForms
- Update QuizSelector to use published_quizzes

### Week 2
- Implement 7-day IndexedDB cache
- Add differential sync
- Monitor cost reduction

### Week 3
- Metadata-first loading
- Batch operations
- Performance optimization

## Key Insights
- KPFG is internal-only (no roles needed)
- SavedForms is the right place for publish functionality
- 7-day cache is optimal for monthly content updates
- Student collaboration is more important than strict DRM

## Metrics Update
- **Beta signups**: 0 (waiting for content)
- **Content created**: 0 (waiting for publishing implementation)
- **Days to beta**: 10
- **Platform readiness**: 50% (architecture designed)

## Tomorrow's Priorities
1. Start implementing Cloud Function
2. Add publish button to SavedForms UI
3. Update Firestore security rules
4. Begin cache service enhancement

## Notes
- Documentation moved to central /docs folder (submodules issue resolved)
- Security approach balances protection with user experience
- Cost efficiency is primary driver of technical decisions
