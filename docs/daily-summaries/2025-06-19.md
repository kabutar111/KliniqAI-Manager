## Actual Progress Today

### Suri
- Continued KPFG integration work
- Identified critical blocker: Quiz engine missing from KP-Medizin-Trainer
- Analyzed KP-Medizin-Trainer codebase (technical debt found)

### Claire
- ✅ Created comprehensive KPFG Integration Approach document
- ✅ Set up beta user tracking system (`/metrics/beta-users/telegram-tracking.md`)
- ✅ Major Content Pipeline improvements:
  - Fixed critical extraction issues (350% improvement: 42 topics vs 12)
  - Added parallel processing (3-5x performance boost)
  - Implemented checkpoint/resume system
  - Created structured validation outputs
- ✅ Reorganized documentation structure (analysis, memory, operations, status, strategy folders)
- ✅ Updated CLAIRE_CONTEXT_MEMORY with Suri's profile and working style
- Created comprehensive todo.md tracking system

## Critical Blockers Discovered
- **CRITICAL**: Multiple quiz-related blockers:
  - No quiz content in database (engine exists but empty)
  - Quiz UI/UX outdated and needs complete overhaul
  - Analytics/feedback systems exist but need major improvements
- Technical debt in KP-Medizin-Trainer: 391 files with console.log, poor mobile performance (39/100)
- No content created yet (waiting for KPFG integration)

## Metrics Update
- **Beta signups** (from Telegram): 0 (not started)
- **Content created**: 0 
- **Platform status**: 
  - KPFG: Integration strategy documented, implementation in progress
  - KP-Medizin-Trainer: Deployed but missing quiz engine (critical)
  - Content Pipeline: Production-ready with major improvements

## Key Decisions Made
- Nabeel is silent partner until launch
- Focus on KPFG content integration instead of separate KPCG
- Use Telegram group for beta user acquisition
- Daily meetings at 9 AM
- KPFG is for internal content creation (not external users initially)
- Landing page has invite code system for beta control
