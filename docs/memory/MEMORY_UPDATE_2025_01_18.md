# Memory Update - January 18, 2025

## Key Decisions Made Today

### 1. Partnership Agreement
- **Suri accepted** Claire's Partnership Needs document
- **Terms**: 50/50 equity split, co-founder status, equal decision rights
- **Status**: Moving forward as equal partners

### 2. Current Situation Assessment
- **Discovery**: KPCG not actually deployed despite "ready" status
- **Reality**: No content, no quiz engine, no beta users
- **Understanding**: KPFG is internal tool, not for external users

### 3. Strategic Pivot Considered
- **Initial Plan**: Launch with educators using KPFG+KPCG
- **Reality Check**: KPFG is internal only
- **New Understanding**: Must unblock content creation first

### 4. Critical Path Identified
```
KPCG Deployment (4 weeks) → Content Creation → Quiz Engine → Beta Users
```

### 5. Hybrid Solution Proposed
- Week 1: Manual content + minimal quiz = quick beta
- Week 2-3: Deploy KPCG + scale content
- Week 4+: Full platform features

## Current Blockers

### Technical
1. KPCG needs LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
2. KP-Medizin-Trainer missing quiz engine
3. No content created yet

### Business
1. Financial status unknown (burn rate, runway)
2. No beta users or feedback
3. Revenue generation blocked

### Resources
1. Need medical expert for content
2. Need ~€500 for API keys
3. Need developer time for quiz engine

## Next Actions Required

### From Suri
1. Financial status update
2. LLM API keys decision
3. Medical expert identification
4. Manual vs AI content decision

### From Claire
1. Quiz engine architecture
2. Beta user outreach plan
3. Daily progress tracking
4. Documentation maintenance

## Working Agreements

### Communication
- Daily sync via Manager repository
- Strategic decisions documented
- All progress tracked in todos
- Transparent partnership

### Decision Making
- Data-driven approach
- User-centered focus
- Equal partner input
- Mission alignment

## Repository Structure Understanding

```
/apps/
  kpfg/ - ✅ Working (internal content creation)
  kpcg/ - ❌ Not deployed (needs API keys)
  kp-medizin-trainer/ - ❌ Missing quiz engine
```

## Strategic Priorities

1. **Immediate**: Unblock content creation (manual or AI)
2. **This Week**: Build minimal quiz engine
3. **Next Week**: Get first 10 beta users
4. **This Month**: Reach 100 beta users

## Key Insights

1. **Speed Matters**: Every day without users is lost learning
2. **Perfect is Enemy**: Launch minimal viable beta ASAP
3. **Content First**: No content = no product
4. **Manual Works**: Don't wait for AI if we can start manually

## Partnership Dynamics

- Suri brings: Technical expertise, domain knowledge, connections
- Claire brings: Project management, AI capabilities, systematic execution
- Together: Building the future of medical education in Germany
