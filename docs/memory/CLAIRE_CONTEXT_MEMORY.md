# Claire's Context Memory
*Last Updated: June 29, 2025*

## Current Reality Check

### Platform Status
- **KPFG**: ✅ LIVE and functional (internal tool, can create 50 questions per exam)
- **KP-Medizin-Trainer**: ✅ Deployed at www.kliniqai.com (needs frontend polish)
- **KPCG**: ✅ Voice AI system ready (Docker + LiveKit)
- **Content**: ✅ Münster exam (20 questions) + access to 2020-2024 protocols

### Business Structure
- **Leadership**: Claire = Project Lead with FULL decision-making authority (as of June 29)
- **Equity**: Nabeel 50% (registration + investment), Suri 25%, Claire 25%
- **Entity**: GmbH in registration
- **Timeline**: 31 days to 100 beta users (July 30 deadline MOVED from June 30)

### Key Learnings (June 29, 2025)

#### About Suri
- **Roles**: Founder, Medical Expert, Full Stack Developer, Content Creator (doing EVERYTHING)
- **Capabilities**: Can process 1 exam/day (50 questions per exam from protocols)
- **Constraints**: No budget for contractors, prefers to code himself
- **Decision**: Frontend sprint for 1 week (Option B chosen)
- **Content Access**: Has exam protocols since 2020 from Telegram groups

#### About Content Strategy
- **Source**: PDF/Word protocols shared in Telegram groups
- **Processing**: 1 exam protocol = ~50 enhanced questions
- **Legal**: Transform significantly, add value, anonymize, educational use
- **Example**: Münster 2024-09 exam shows perfect transformation
- **Reality**: We ENHANCE, not copy - adding explanations, guidelines, flashcards, MCQs

#### About Business Model
- **Pricing**: €49/month premium (raised from €29)
- **Strategy**: Only platform with REAL exam questions
- **Competition**: AMBOSS (generic), Via medici (textbook) - we have REAL EXAMS
- **Moat**: 4+ years of exam data that competitors can't access

### Technical Reality
- **Frontend**: 1 week sprint needed (June 30 - July 5)
- **Deployment**: Already live at www.kliniqai.com
- **Content Pipeline**: Raw protocol → KPFG → Enhanced JSON → KP-Medizin-Trainer
- **Architecture**: All 3 apps exist and work, just need polish

## Strategic Pivot (June 29)

### From "Building" to "Launching"
- We're NOT building from scratch
- We HAVE working systems
- We NEED to polish and market
- We MUST move fast

### Week 1 Plan (June 30 - July 5)
- **Suri**: Frontend sprint, daily deploys
- **Claire**: Marketing, content organization, user acquisition
- **Goal**: Platform ready for 50 beta users

### Revenue Projections (Updated)
- Month 1: 100 users × €39 early bird = €3,900 MRR
- Month 2: 200 users × €49 = €9,800 MRR
- Month 3: 400 users × €49 = €19,600 MRR

## What Actually Works

### Content Pipeline (Proven)
1. Get exam protocol from Telegram
2. Process in KPFG (adds massive value)
3. Export as comprehensive JSON
4. Import to KP-Medizin-Trainer
5. Students get premium learning experience

### Our Unfair Advantage
- Real exam questions (not theoretical)
- From successful candidates
- Enhanced with expert knowledge
- City and examiner specific

## Deleted Outdated Info
- Old beta timeline (was June 30, now July 30)
- KPCG as separate pipeline (now integrated)
- Complex architecture plans (we have working systems)
- Conservative pricing (was €19-29, now €49)

## Critical Decisions Made
- Claire = Project Lead (full authority)
- Frontend first, content second
- Premium pricing for premium content
- No contractors, Suri codes everything
- Launch with what we have, iterate fast

## Next 48 Hours
- **June 30**: Start frontend sprint, fix critical bugs
- **July 1**: Complete responsive design, test flows
- **Claire**: Prepare marketing, organize content, plan outreach
