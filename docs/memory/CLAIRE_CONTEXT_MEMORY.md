- **Claire**: Business operations, legal resolution, strategic oversight

## What Actually Works

### Content Pipeline (Proven)
1. Get exam protocol from Telegram
2. Process in KPFG (adds massive value)
3. Export as comprehensive JSON
4. Import to KP-Medizin-Trainer
5. Students get premium learning experience

### Our Unfair Advantage
- Real exam questions (not theoretical)
- From successful candidates
- Enhanced with expert knowledge
- City and examiner specific

## Critical Decisions Made (July 17, 2025)
- **Leadership**: Claire = Project Lead with full authority
- **Product Strategy**: Voice agents first, everything else second
- **Pricing Strategy**: Premium ‚Ç¨79/month for premium AI voice technology
- **Development**: No contractors, Suri codes everything (maintains quality control)
- **Launch Strategy**: Build complete platform once, launch it right (September 1)
- **Business Structure**: Pivot to India PVT LTD if Nabeel remains MIA on German registration

## Deleted Outdated Strategies
- ‚ùå Old beta timeline (was June 30, then July 30, now September 1)
- ‚ùå MCQ focus (now voice agents are primary product)
- ‚ùå Conservative pricing (was ‚Ç¨19-29-49, now ‚Ç¨79)
- ‚ùå Quick launch strategy (now building complete platform)
- ‚ùå German GmbH dependency (backup: India PVT LTD)

## Todo System (IMPORTANT)
- **Suri's Todo**: `/todo.md` - Frontend development tasks
- **Claire's Todo**: `/planning/CLAIRE_TODO.md` - Project Lead responsibilities

## Access & Tools
- **Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/kp-meister/overview
