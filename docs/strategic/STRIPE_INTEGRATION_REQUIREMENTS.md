- **Trial Period**: 7-day free trial for voice features
- **Billing Cycle**: Monthly recurring

### User Access Control

### Database Schema Updates

#### Users Collection
```javascript
{
  // existing fields...
  subscription: {
    stripeCustomerId: string,
    subscriptionId: string,
    status: 'active' | 'canceled' | 'past_due' | 'trialing',
    currentPeriodEnd: timestamp,
    priceId: string,
    voiceAgentAccess: boolean
  }
}
```

#### Subscriptions Collection
```javascript
{
  userId: string,
  stripeSubscriptionId: string,
  status: string,
  priceId: string,
  currentPeriodStart: timestamp,

}
```

## Security Considerations

- **PCI Compliance**: Use Stripe Elements (no card data touches our servers)
- **Webhook Security**: Verify webhook signatures
- **Access Control**: Server-side validation of subscription status
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive subscription data

## Monitoring & Analytics

- **Payment Success Rate**: Track successful vs failed payments
- **Subscription Churn**: Monitor cancellation rates
- **Revenue Metrics**: MRR, ARPU, LTV tracking
- **User Behavior**: Voice agent usage by subscription tier

## Launch Metrics Target

- **Day 1**: 10 premium subscribers (€790 MRR)
- **Week 1**: 25 premium subscribers (€1,975 MRR)
- **Month 1**: 100 premium subscribers (€7,900 MRR)
- **Payment Success Rate**: >95%
- **Churn Rate**: <5% monthly

## Risk Mitigation

- **Payment Failures**: Dunning management for failed payments
- **Subscription Disputes**: Clear refund policy and process
- **Technical Issues**: Fallback payment methods and retry logic
- **Compliance**: GDPR compliance for payment data

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Seamless payment flow with <2 minute checkout
- [ ] Automatic user access control for voice agents
- [ ] Real-time subscription status updates
- [ ] Self-service account management
- [ ] €7,900 MRR target achieved by October 1
