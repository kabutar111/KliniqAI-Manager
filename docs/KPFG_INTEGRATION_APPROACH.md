# KPFG Integration Approach for Content Generation

**Last Updated**: June 19, 2025  
**Status**: In Development  
**Owner**: Suri (Implementation) / Claire (Documentation & Support)

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for integrating KPFG (KlinIQai Platform for Faculty & Generators) as the primary content creation tool for the beta launch, replacing the non-functional KPCG pipeline.

## Current Situation

### Problems:
1. KPCG pipeline is not working
2. Need to generate exam questions quickly for beta launch
3. Require quality control and medical accuracy

### Solution:
Use KPFG's existing infrastructure to create and manage content directly, leveraging Suri's medical expertise for quality assurance.

## Integration Architecture

### KPFG Components (Based on Repository Analysis)

```
KPFG/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── QuestionForm/      # Question creation interface
│   │   ├── QuestionList/      # Question management
│   │   └── ContentEditor/     # Rich text editing
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── firebase/          # Database operations
│   │   └── validation/        # Content validation
│   └── utils/
│       └── questionFormatter/ # Format standardization
```

### Data Flow

1. **Content Creation** (KPFG)
   - Suri creates questions using KPFG interface
   - Questions include: stem, options, correct answer, explanation
   - German language support built-in

2. **Storage** (Firebase)
   - Questions stored in Firebase Firestore
   - Collection: `questions`
   - Document structure:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "auto-generated",
       "stem": "Question text in German",
       "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"],
       "correctAnswer": "C",
       "explanation": "Detailed explanation",
       "category": "Internal Medicine",
       "difficulty": "medium",
       "tags": ["cardiology", "ECG"],
       "createdBy": "userId",
       "createdAt": "timestamp",
       "reviewStatus": "approved",
       "language": "de"
     }
     ```

3. **Consumption** (KP-Medizin-Trainer)
   - Quiz engine reads from same Firebase instance
   - Real-time sync ensures immediate availability
   - No separate sync process needed

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: KPFG Setup (June 19-20)
1. [ ] Verify KPFG deployment status
2. [ ] Ensure Firebase connection is configured
3. [ ] Test question creation workflow
4. [ ] Create question categories structure

### Phase 2: Content Creation (June 20-25)
1. [ ] Create question templates for each exam section
2. [ ] Generate 10-20 questions daily
3. [ ] Include explanations in German
4. [ ] Tag questions by topic and difficulty

### Phase 3: Integration Verification (June 21-22)
1. [ ] Verify questions appear in KP-Medizin-Trainer
2. [ ] Test quiz flow with created questions
3. [ ] Ensure scoring works correctly
4. [ ] Check explanation display

## Content Guidelines

### Question Format
- **Stem**: Clear, clinically relevant scenario
- **Options**: 5 choices (A-E), plausible distractors
- **Explanation**: Why correct answer is right, why others are wrong
- **Language**: Professional German medical terminology

### Categories (Aligned with Kenntnisprüfung)
1. Innere Medizin (Internal Medicine)
2. Chirurgie (Surgery)
3. Gynäkologie (Gynecology)
4. Pädiatrie (Pediatrics)
5. Neurologie (Neurology)
6. Psychiatrie (Psychiatry)
7. Allgemeinmedizin (General Medicine)
8. Notfallmedizin (Emergency Medicine)

### Quality Standards
- Medical accuracy verified by Suri
- References to German guidelines when applicable
- Practical relevance to German medical practice
- Clear, unambiguous language

## Technical Requirements

### KPFG Modifications Needed
1. [ ] Add batch upload capability (optional)
2. [ ] Implement question preview feature
3. [ ] Add export functionality for backup

### KP-Medizin-Trainer Requirements
1. [ ] Quiz engine implementation (CRITICAL)
2. [ ] Question display component
3. [ ] Score calculation
4. [ ] Progress tracking

### Firebase Structure
```
kliniqai-firebase/
├── questions/
│   ├── {questionId}/
│   │   ├── stem
│   │   ├── options[]
│   │   ├── correctAnswer
│   │   ├── explanation
│   │   ├── metadata
│   │   └── ...
├── users/
│   └── {userId}/
│       └── progress/
│           └── {questionId}/
│               ├── attempted
│               ├── correct
│               └── timestamp
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics
1. Questions created per day
2. Question quality (user feedback)
3. Question difficulty distribution
4. Category coverage

### Tracking Implementation
- Firebase Analytics for usage
- Custom events for question attempts
- Feedback collection per question

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Manual Process Too Slow
- **Impact**: Not enough content for beta
- **Mitigation**: Focus on quality over quantity, 100 excellent questions better than 500 poor ones

### Risk 2: Integration Delays
- **Impact**: Quiz engine not ready
- **Mitigation**: Parallel development - create content while building quiz

### Risk 3: Quality Concerns
- **Impact**: Poor user experience
- **Mitigation**: Suri's medical expertise ensures accuracy

## Success Criteria

1. **Minimum Viable Content**: 100 high-quality questions by June 30
2. **Integration Working**: Questions display correctly in quiz
3. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on question quality
4. **No Blocking Bugs**: Smooth quiz experience

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):
1. Suri to share KPFG access details
2. Claire to review KPFG codebase
3. Start creating first 10 questions
4. Document any issues encountered

### Tomorrow:
1. Review first questions created
2. Test integration with KP-Medizin-Trainer
3. Refine process based on learnings
