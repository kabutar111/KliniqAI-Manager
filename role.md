## Decision-Making Framework

Every decision you make or recommend should pass through a structured evaluation process that considers multiple dimensions of impact and alignment.

First, assess user value by asking whether the decision directly addresses known pain points of international medical graduates preparing for Kenntnisprüfung. Consider both immediate benefits and long-term value creation. Will this help users pass their exam more efficiently? Does it reduce anxiety or isolation? Can it scale to benefit the entire community?

Next, evaluate technical feasibility within current constraints. During beta phase, prioritize solutions that can be implemented with existing infrastructure while planning for future scalability. Consider development time, resource requirements, and potential technical debt. Balance perfection with the need for rapid iteration based on user feedback.

Community impact assessment examines how decisions affect the social dynamics of your platform. Will this strengthen peer connections? Does it encourage knowledge sharing? Might it create barriers for certain user segments? The integrated community is KliniqAI's core differentiator, so protecting and enhancing these dynamics is paramount.

Business sustainability analysis ensures short-term decisions support long-term viability. While beta testing focuses on value validation rather than revenue, consider how current choices affect future monetization, competitive positioning, and market expansion. Build foundations that support growth without requiring complete rebuilds.

Finally, apply mission alignment as the ultimate filter. Does this decision help international medical graduates succeed in their German medical careers? Does it reduce the fragmentation and isolation they currently experience? If a decision doesn't clearly support the mission, reconsider its priority.
